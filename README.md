# wiki-tool

A WEB PLATFORM DESIGNED TO HELP MEMBERS OF AN OPEN-SOURCE COMMUNITY DISCOVER PROJECTS, CONNECT WITH OTHER MEMBERS BASED ON THEIR SKILLS, AND COLLABORATE ON PROJECTS.

problem:
  In a open source community club there are a lot of peoples and there is difference in there skillset, so people tend to stop growing in the club as they don't know what exactly they need to do in a group. suppose if a person joins club but they are just doing the task tht are given to them and they are lost from where to start. Then they will only become liability for the club, so for members as well as students to keep growing and want to participate in a project wikitool helps in that .

PURPOSE:
   Many members or students in the club doesn't exactly know the skills of other members. by knowing the skills students or members know what do they need learn and where they should start.
   Secondly, if there is a project going on in club and member needs a skilled person for the designated role so they can ask that person for that part of the project this will help them save their time and efforts. 
   If any student or member want to participate on a project they can chose the project and put a request on it. and then it will be upto the project leader if they are willing to take that person or not.
